write a blog on the difference between document and window objects?

The Document Object:
The Document object represents the web page itself, typically referred to as the Document Object Model (DOM). 
It represents the HTML content of a web page and provides methods and properties to manipulate the elements within the page. 
The Document object is accessible through the "document" keyword in JavaScript.
Key features of the Document object include:
a. DOM Manipulation: The Document object allows you to manipulate the content, structure, and style of the web page. 
You can access and modify elements, create new elements, change text content, add or remove classes, and handle events associated with the elements.
b. Selecting Elements: It provides various methods like getElementById(), getElementsByTagName(), and querySelector() to select and 
interact with specific elements on the page.
c. Loading and Event Handling: The Document object allows you to handle events such as page load, form submissions, clicks, and keyboard interactions.

The Window Object:
The Window object represents the browser window or tab that contains the Document object. 
It serves as the global object in the browser environment and provides methods and properties related to the window itself. 
In JavaScript, you can access the Window object using the "window" keyword.
Key features of the Window object include:
a. Global Scope: The Window object acts as the global scope for JavaScript code running within a web page.
   Variables and functions declared without the "var", "let", or "const" keywords become properties of the Window object and can be accessed globally.
b. Navigation and Location: The Window object enables navigation within the browser window. 
   It provides methods like open(), close(), reload(), and properties such as location, history, and navigator for controlling the window and managing its behavior.
c. Timing and Intervals: The Window object offers methods like setTimeout() and setInterval() to execute functions after a specified delay or at regular intervals.

Key Differences Between Document and Window Objects:

Scope: The Document object operates within the context of a single web page, representing the HTML structure. 
	In contrast, the Window object represents the entire browser window or tab and provides a global scope for JavaScript code within that window.

Functionality: The Document object primarily focuses on manipulating the content and structure of the web page, 
               providing methods to interact with the DOM. The Window object, on the other hand, deals with managing the browser window, 
	       controlling navigation, handling events, and providing global functionalities.

Access: While the Document object is accessed using the "document" keyword, the Window object is accessed using the "window" keyword. 
        Both can be accessed from within JavaScript code running in a web page.
